# Oxidizer: Distributed Adaptive Benchmarking System

Oxidizer is an advanced benchmarking system designed to perform precise and detailed performance analysis in distributed environments. Leveraging Rust for efficiency and safety, Oxidizer offers a flexible and powerful platform to evaluate code performance across different architectures and conditions.

## Features

- Distributed benchmarking
- Secure and efficient communication protocol
- Adaptive compilation for different architectures
- In-depth performance analysis
- Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Advanced result visualization

## System Architecture

Oxidizer consists of the following main components:

1. CLI (Command Line Interface)
